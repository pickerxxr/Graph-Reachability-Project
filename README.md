# Label-constrained Rechability Query on Dynamic Graphs

## Intro

This is the implementation of **Label-constrained Rechability Query on Dynamic Graphs**, which is the experimental implementations of the final project of DATA130045.01.

Created by Alan Liu from Fudan.

Based on the Master thsis of L.D.J. (Lucien) Valstar from TU/e, which implements the basic version of Label-constrained reachability query indexing methods.

The dynamic part, i.e., the expperiments of dynamic cases MaintenessExp.cpp is added into Index/UnboundedLCR.

## Usage

### install the necessary packs (NECESSARY)

```
GNU gcc&g++
boost
glog gflags
Python 3.6 or higher version

```
###
```
cd LCRIndexing
chmod a+x rebuild.sh
./rebuild.sh
```


## Explaination

### Testing
Since the codes are originally for evaluating the performances of different algorithms, it is not a full executable version.
You can check the details directly, with detailed comments.
